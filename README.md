## Project 1 - Memory ECC Lab Course

## Project 2 â€“ Encrypted FS on FUSE
Resources:
1.	Less Simple, Yet Stupid Filesystem (Using FUSE): https://github.com/MaaSTaaR/LSYSFS
2.	In Storage Filesystem (ISFS) Using FUSE: https://github.com/yttty/isfs

Part 1 : Setting Up FUSE environment

Part 2 : Building a Basic In-Memory File System with FUSE: Using the FUSE framework, create a simple in-memory file system. This file system should support basic operations such as:
+ Create, read, and write files.
+ Open and close files.
+ Create and remove directories.
+ List directory contents.

Part 3 : Integrating AES-256 Encryption: Extend your file system to encrypt file data using AES-256 encryption before writing to memory and decrypt data when reading from memory. Utilize a cryptographic library such as OpenSSL for implementing AES encryption.

Part 4 : Encryption Key Management: Implement a mechanism for managing encryption keys, ensuring that each file can be encrypted with a different key. Design the system so that the encryption key must be supplied to open a file. 

Part 5 : File Operations with Encryption: Ensure all file operations (read, write, etc.) handle encrypted data correctly.

Part 6  : Testing and Validation: Conduct comprehensive tests to verify the functionality with encrypted files. Ensure encrypted files are unreadable without the correct decryption key and readable with it.

Part 7 : Demonstration and Presentation: Make appointment with TA to demonstrate your developed encrypted FS on FUSE. You should detail the project architecture, encountered challenges, implemented solutions, and key learnings.
